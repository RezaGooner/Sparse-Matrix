# Sparse Matrix Representation in C++

This repository contains an implementation of a **Sparse Matrix** in **C++**. It demonstrates efficient storage and manipulation of sparse matrices, which are matrices primarily filled with zeros. This is achieved using compact representations, such as storing only non-zero elements with their respective row and column indices.

## Features
‚ú® **Compact Storage**  
‚ùó **Efficient Memory Usage**  
üîß **Basic Operations Support**  
- Addition  
- Scalar Multiplication  
- Matrix Multiplication

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Operating System: Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RezaGooner/Sparse-Matrix.git
```
2. Navigate to the project folder and compile the code:
```bash
g++ Sparse\ Matrix.cpp -o sparse_matrix
./sparse_matrix
```

## Example Output
The program performs operations on a sparse matrix and prints the results.
